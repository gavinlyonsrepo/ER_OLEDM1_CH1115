* Version 1.1.0 June 2021

* Version 1.3.0 Feb 2022
	* drawBitmap() function is now set up for both horizontal and vertical addressed bitmap data,
	  Vertical is default. The addressing mode is changed by setDrawBitmapAddr(), new function.  
	* Enum added for font name labels instead of raw numbers, 
	  This will cause font compiler warnings for sketch's written on versions before 1.3.0 , 
	  The sketch's will still compile and work,
	  Simply replace font numbers  with the relevant enum text labels to get rid of warnings.
